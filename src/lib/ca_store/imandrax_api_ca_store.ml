(** Storage based on cryptographic content-addressing.

    This library provides several ways to store data
    in a content-addressed way.

    One way, {!Ca_ptr}, is to serialize the data and hash its serialized
    version (classic content addressing). Another way is to use
    a {!Cname.t} for data that has already been content-addressed
    {i before} serialization â€” that can be more efficient because we don't
    always need to serialize a value if it's found to be stored already
    based on its cname.
