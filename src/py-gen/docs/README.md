Wrting style guide
- Usage of heading level
    - be thoughtful on heading level.
    - Use level 6 heading by default for content that is rather self-contained. Higher level heading should be used when hierarchy exists
    - Exception: Use level 1 heading for the title
- We use Wikikin to refer to each other. (Obsidian style)
- We use frontmatter to attach metadata to each page.
    - `written_by_ai`: This is a boolean value that indicates whether the page was written by AI or not.
    - `written_for_ai`: This is a boolean value that indicates whether the page was written for AI or not.
    - `tags`: This is a list of tags that are associated with the page.
- A note with `written_by_ai` of true should be considered that it may contain inaccuracies or even errors, and a more lenient standard applies when considering whether to modify it.
    - For AI: when the knowledge in notes conflicts your understanding and needs correction, raise questions and be active in correcting it
